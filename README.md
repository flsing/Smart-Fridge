# Smart Fridge 

Term project to be completed by myself and Patrick Langis. It is still a work in progress. 
 
 We used a bootstrap template in order to create the webpage. 
 
 We used Flask and Python for the back-end and in order to connect to our database that was created in Postgresql.  

 Make your way to the directory that contains the project. 

You first have to enter the Virtual Environment 

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

In order to set up the environment you need to do the following command once you are in the venv. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, run app.py 


```
python app.py
```

You should now be good to go!

Enjoy
